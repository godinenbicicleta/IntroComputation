Think about objects as collection of both data and the methods that operate on that data

Abstract Data Type:
set of objects and the operations on those objects

Methods:
When a function definition occurs within a class definition, de defined function is called
a method and is associated with the class

Classes support two types of operations:
1. Instantiation is used to create instances of the class
    s = IntSet() creates a new object of type IntSet, this object is called an instance of IntSet
2. Attributes references use dot notation to acces attributes associated with the class, for example s.member refers to the method member associated with the instance s of type IntSet


class IntSet(object) means IntSet is a subclass of object

__init__
whenever a class is instantiated, a call is made to the __init__ method defined in that class

when s = IntSet() is excecuted, the interpreter will create a new instance of type IntSet and then call IntSet.__init__
